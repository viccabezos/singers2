# Change: Define Project Structure

## Why
The project needs a clear architectural foundation defining the separation between the public website and private back office, establishing the tech stack, database integration, and following Feature-Sliced Design principles.

## What Changes
- Define public website application structure
- Define private back office application structure  
- Establish authentication mechanism for back office (single password)
- Define Supabase database integration
- Establish Feature-Sliced Design architecture patterns
- Set up routing structure for both applications

## Impact
- Affected specs: `public-website`, `back-office`, `auth`, `database-integration`, `project-architecture`
- Affected code: Root application structure, routing, authentication middleware
