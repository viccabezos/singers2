# Change: Create Public App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Why
The public-facing application for Les Chanteurs choir needs a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) to guide development. While the admin back-office has been extensively developed with full CRUD operations for events, playlists, and songs, the public app currently has minimal implementation. A PRD is needed to:

1. Define the complete user experience for choir members and audience
2. Ensure alignment between admin capabilities and public features
3. Guide development priorities based on user needs and technical constraints
4. Document the roadmap for future enhancements (QR codes, social sharing, AI assistant)

## What Changes
- Create comprehensive PRD document covering all public app features
- Define user personas, user flows, and UX requirements
- Map admin features to public app capabilities
- Document technical requirements and constraints
- Define MVP scope vs. future roadmap items
- Create detailed specifications for each public page/feature

## Impact
- Affected specs: public-website (major expansion)
- New documentation: Full PRD in `openspec/changes/create-public-app-prd/`
- Related changes: May require updates to existing specs based on PRD decisions
- No code changes at this stage - this is documentation/planning only
