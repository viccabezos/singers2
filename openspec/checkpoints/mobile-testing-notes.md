## Issues Found

### 1. Login page showing nav FAB
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Filters take too much space on mobile
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Page**: events / songs/ playlists
- **Description**: Mobile now shows search bar + filter icon button that opens a bottom sheet
- **TODO for later**: Align desktop filter panel style with mobile (inline search + popover instead of full panel)

### 3. 
- **Status**: 🔲 Open
- **Page**: events
- **Description**: the list is shown as a card rather than a Table, i think it's not itself a bad idea but the UX UI just does not work at all
